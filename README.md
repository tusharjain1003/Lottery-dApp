[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized query protocol and indexing service for the blockchain. It allows developers to easily track events being emitted from smart contracts on various networks, and write custom data transformation scripts, which are run in real time. The data is also made available through a simple GraphQL API which developers can then use to display things on their frontends.

Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably-fair and verifiable source of randomness designed for smart contracts. Smart contract developers can use Chainlink VRF as a tamper-proof random number generator (RNG) to build reliable smart contracts for any applications which rely on unpredictable outcomes.
